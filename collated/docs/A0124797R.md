### Finding tasks that contain any keywords: `find`

Even with the list category feature, scrolling through possibly thousands of tasks to find a specific one can be quite troublesome. Fret not! _Mastermind_ provides you with the `find` command to quickly search for a specific task your are looking for.

`find` command displays a result of all tasks whose description contain any of the given keywords.

_Format:_

```java
find <keyword>...
```

>* The search is case-insensitive.
>* The order of the keywords does not matter.
>* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned.

_Examples:_

```java
// returns Dinner on 10/10/16 at 1900hrs (Date)
> find Dinner
```  
```java
// returns CS2010 PS10 on 11 Oct by 1000hrs (Assignment)
> find "cs2010 ps10"
```  
> using find will always switch back to the home tab.

### Finding all tasks that contain specific tags: `findtag`

You have tagged your tasks previously and now you want to know what tasks are in that category.
you can use `findtag` command to quickly search for tasks that are tagged with that specific tag.

`findtag` command display result of all tasks whose tags contain the given keywords.

_Format:_

```java
findtag <keyword>...
```

>* The search is case-sensitive.
>* The order of the keywords does not matter.
>* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned.

_Examples:_

```java
// returns Dinner on 10/10/16 at 1900hrs (Date)
> findtag date
```  


### Show upcoming tasks : `upcoming`

What if you have too many task to do and only want to know tasks that are going to be due. You can ask _Mastermind_ to list `upcoming` tasks!

_Format:_
```java
upcoming [tab_name]
```

> * Shows all floating tasks as well if there is no `[tab_name]` included.
> * Does not show tasks that are already due.

_Examples:_
```java
// list all tasks that are due within a weeks time.
> upcoming
```
```java
// list all deadlines that are due within a weeks time.
> upcoming deadlines
```



### Changing save location : `relocate`

_Mastermind_ allows you to relocate the save file to a new destination folder.

_Format:_
```
relocate <new_folder_destination>
```

_Example:_
```java
// save file has been relocated to new destination folder at ~/document/mastermind
> relocate ~/document/mastermind
```

> You can relocate into a cloud shared folder to access your save data from any other computer!
>
> Remember to input a folder and not a file!

### Importing file : `import`

_Mastermind_ allows you to import file from other to do list into _Mastermind_.

Currently _Mastermind_ supports _.csv_ and _.ics_ file.

> _.csv_ must be compliant to Google Calendar [specification](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en).

_Format:_
```
import from <file location>
```

_Example:_
```java
// import success
> import from ~/document/mastermind/data.ics
```

### Exporting data: `export`

_Mastermind_ can assist you in exporting your data to _.csv_ format too. The _.csv_ file is fully compatible with Google Calendar so you can use it to synchronize with your personal calendar.

_Format:_
```java
export [tasks] [deadlines] [events] [archives] to <destination_file_path>
```

_Example:_
```java
// export all data to personal folder
> export to C:\Users\Jim\mastermind.csv
```

```java
// export only deadlines and events data to personal folder
> export events deadlines to C:\Users\Jim\mastermind.csv
```
```

### Model component

<img src="images/Model_diagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores _Mastermind_'s data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

##### Task & TaskBuilder

The `Task.java` and `TaskBuilder.java` can be found in `harmony.mastermind.model.task` package.

We identified three different types of Tasks (Floating, Deadlines, Events), which differ only by the existence of start date and end date in their respective attributes. While inheritance seems to be a viable solution, it's not necessary true that a floating task is interchangeable with deadline and event, or vice versa. Moreover, how can we prevent the user from entering a start date without end date?

Eventually, we resolved this issue by using the [Builder Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/builder_pattern.htm). This gives us the following benefits:

- **Avoid long constructor**: `Task` object has many optional attributes, therefore it's impractical to keep multiple constructors with long parameter list. Builder pattern mitigates such problem by using step by step approach to build the `Task` object.

- **Increase Readability**: The object creation process uses fluent method name that is much more readable than conventional constructor approach.

- **Enforce mandatory attributes**: The only way to set the start and end date through `TaskBuilder` is by using `asEvent()`, `asDeadline()`, `asFloating()` methods. Ideally, the `TaskBuilder` should return an immutable `ReadOnlyTask` upon building. There's no way that the user can create a `Task` with start date but without an end date.

_Example:_
```java
TaskBuilder taskBuilder = new TaskBuilder(taskName);
taskBuilder.withCreationDate(createdDate);
taskBuilder.withTags(tags);
taskBuilder.asRecurring(recur);

if (isEvent()){
    taskBuilder.asEvent(startDate,endDate);
} else if (isDeadline()){
    taskBuilder.asDeadline(endDate);
} else if (isFloating()){
    taskBuilder.asFloating();
}

Task task = taskBuilder.build();
```

```
