### Completing tasks : `mark`

Mission accomplished! Now you can ask _Mastermind_ to `mark` a task as completed.

_Mastermind_ will archive the task for you. See <kbd>Archives</kbd> tab to review your completed task.

_Format:_
```java
mark <index>
```
```java
mark due
```

> ```mark``` only affects tasks that are not complete yet. It has no effect on completed tasks.

> Using `mark due` it will mark all tasks that are due.

_Examples:_
```java
// use "find" command to look for a specific task
> find CS2010

// select the "find" result and mark the task at index 1 as completed
> mark 1
```

```java
// marks all due tasks in the tab
> mark due
```
### Unmarking a task : `unmark`

Oh no! You realise that one of your task is not complete yet but you have marked it. Not to worry, you can `unmark` that task.

_Format:_
```java
unmark <index>
```

> ```unmark``` only affects task that are completed. It has no effect on an uncompleted task.

_Examples:_
```java
// list all the tasks that are completed
> list archives

// mark task at index 1 as completed
> unmark 1
```

```java
// use "find" command to look for a specific task
> find CS2010

// select the "find" result and mark the task at index 1 as completed
> unmark 1
```


### Deleting a task : `delete`

You just realize Taylor Swift concert is cancelled! Oh no!

Sadly, you have to ask _Mastermind_ to remove the event from your bucket list. _Mastermind_ does the removal for you with a sympathetic pat on your shoulder.

_Format:_
```java
delete <index>
```

>* Deletes the task at the specified `index`.
>* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.

_Examples:_
```java
// delete entry listed at index 1
> delete 1
```

### Undo a command : `undo`

Suddenly, you received a call that Taylor Swift concert is coming back up! Maybe you should buy the ticket after all.

Don't worry. _Mastermind_ has a built in time machine that helps you travel to the past! You can execute the `undo` command to recover the task you just deleted!

_Format:_
```java
undo
```

> `undo` only affect commands such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `mark`, `unmark`. It has no effect on command such as `list`, `find`, `relocate`, `import`, `export`, `history` and `clear`.

Example:
```java
// deleted the task: "Buy ticket for Taylor Swift concert"
> delete 1

// Undo the last action
> undo

// returns
// Undo successfully.
// =====Undo Details=====
// [Undo Delete Command] Task added: Buy ticket for Taylor Swift concert. Tags:
// ==================
```

> You can `undo` as many times as you like.
>
> However, the `undo` takes effect on commands that you entered in the current session only. _Mastermind_ will forget the `undo` history once you close the application.

### Redo a command : `redo`

_Mastermind_ can travel back to the present too! If you ever regret your `undo` command, _Mastermind_ can `redo` command that you just undid.

_Format:_
```java
redo
```
> `redo` is only available immediately after an `undo` command is used.

_Example:_
```java
// Redo the last command being undone. Refer to undo command.
> redo

// returns
// Redo successfully.
// =====Undo Details=====
// [Redo Delete Command] Task delete: Buy ticket for Taylor Swift concert. Tags:
// ==================
```

> You can `redo` as many times as you like.
>
> However, the `redo` takes effect on commands that you entered in the current session only. _Mastermind_ will forget the `redo` history once you close the application.
>
> Upon executing a new command (except `undo` and `redo`), _Mastermind_ will forget any existing command remaining in the `redo` history.



### Listing all tasks of a category: `list`

After adding some tasks into _Mastermind_, you can `list` them according to their category. In addition to the [three main categories](#adding-a-task-add-do) mentioned in `add` command, _Mastermind_ also keeps a summarized view under <kbd>Home</kbd> tab; the <kbd>Archives</kbd> tab is reserved for task marked as completed.

_Format:_
```java
list [tab_name]
```

> Possible values of `tab_name` includes (case-insensitive):
> `Home`
> `Tasks`
> `Events`
> `Deadlines`
> `Archives`
>
> _Quick Tip: You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd> or <kbd>5</kbd> to switch to the respective tabs._

#### Logic component
`Logic` is the brain of the application as it controls and manages the overall flow of the application. Upon receiving the user input from `UI`, it will process the input using the `Parser` and return the result of executing the user input back to the `UI`. The inputs `Logic` takes in are command words such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, etc. `Logic` will then execute them accordingly based on their functionality. If you were to work on this execution of user input, you will need to access `Storage` through the `EventsCenter` to retrieve and update the state of tasks.

<img src="images/Logic_diagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

##### Parser
`Parser` class uses [Regular Expression](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_regular_expressions.htm) (regex) to extract parameters from raw input. Each `Command` defines the regex in their respective class variable `COMMAND_ARGUMENTS_REGEX`.

`parseCommand()` method registers all the recognized `Command` under `switch` statement.

The regular expression can be tested at [regex101](https://regex101.com).

You can visit the following link to inspect the regex test result for `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`:

- `AddCommand`: [https://regex101.com/r/M2A3tB/15](https://regex101.com/r/M2A3tB/15)

- `EditCommand`: [https://regex101.com/r/VcdUmR/4](https://regex101.com/r/VcdUmR/4)

##### Add
The `add` command allows the user to add tasks, deadlines or events to _Mastermind_. Tasks, deadlines and events are differentiated by which attribute is updated.
> * Floating tasks are tasks without start and end date.
> * Deadlines are tasks with an end date.
> * Events are tasks with both start and end date.
>
All tasks are stored as object attributes such as name, description, end date, start date and type.  

You can refer to Figure 4 and Figure 5 below and the next page for the sequence diagram of `add`.

<img src="images/Add Command Sequence Diagram part 1.png" width="800">  

> Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when _Mastermind_'s data is changed, instead of directly asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk.

<img src="images/Add Command Sequence Diagram part 2.png" width="800">  

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is how we reduce direct coupling between 2 components.


##### Edit
This command allows the users to update attributes of items they have already added in _Mastermind_.  

The user can update the task by choosing the index of the task they want to change. They will then choose the specific field, such as start date, that they want to change.   

However, the user can only update one item at a time. To update, the item being updated must be found, and removed from the `Storage`. After updating the attribute, the item is re-added back into `Storage`. If the update is successful, the details of the item will be shown to the user at the console output. Otherwise, an error message is generated.

The details are shown in the following diagrams.

<img src="images/Edit Command Sequence Diagram part 1.png" width="800">  

2 events are raised during the execution of `Edit`.

<img src="images/Edit Command Sequence Diagram part 2.png" width="800">  


##### Undo & Redo
The `undo` and `redo` commands allow user to recover from mistakes. The user can execute `undo` or `redo` command multiple times to the earliest entry.

Note that _Mastermind_ does not support `undo` or `redo` for `import`, `export`, `list`, `upcoming` and `clear` commands. The undo and redo history will be cleared upon executing such commands.

The `undo` and `redo` commands are session based, meaning that the history will be cleared when the user exit the application.

[insert undo class diagram]

The `undo` command makes use of [Strategy Pattern](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/strategy_pattern.htm) to manage the logic flow. All commands that support `undo` operation must implement the `Undoable` interface. Similarly, to support `redo` operation, the command should implement the `Redoable` interface.

We chose this design pattern because different command has different `undo` behaviour during runtime. Furthermore, it's more intuitive and reasonable to tell the specialized command how to `undo` its own execution.

It's also aligned with the [Open/Close Principle](http://www.oodesign.com/open-close-principle.html) since the `UndoCommand.java` is close for modification, but open for extension to anticipate more `undo` strategies in the future.

[insert undo sequence diagram]

We combine this design with the `Stack` data structure to make sure the commands `undo` in proper sequence. The `ModelManager` will manage this stack as `undoHistoryStack`.

At the end of the command execution, the command should push itself to the `undoHistoryStack`.

Similarly, `redo` command makes use of the Strategy Pattern as well. `ModelManager` keeps two different stacks to control the undo and redo command flow.


##### Mark
The `mark` command allows users to mark their tasks/deadlines/events as completed. This removes the task from the tasks/deadlines/events field, and moves it into the `Archives`. The `mark` command will not delete the task immediately. In the event that users want to unmark the task, users can do so by using the `unmark` Command. Additionally, User can specify `mark due` to bulk mark all tasks that are due.


##### Unmark
The `unmark` command allows users to unmark the tasks in the `Archives` tab. _Mastermind_ will add them back to their original position in their orginal tab.

> This command will only work in the `Archives` tab.


##### Delete
This command allows the user to delete any task they have input into the program beforehand. Users have to specify the index to delete after the command word.

Details are illustrated in the following diagrams.

<img src="images/Delete Command Sequence Diagram part 1.png" width="800">  

> Again, note how that `Model` simply raises an event instead of relying on `Storage` directly.

And `EventsCenter` reacts to the event accordingly.

<img src="images/Delete Command Sequence Diagram part 2.png" width="800">  


##### Clear
`Clear` wipes all tasks(floating tasks, deadlines and events) currently registered in _Mastermind_.  

After inputting the command, the data is cleared from the `Storage` by raising an event to the `EventCenter`.   

> Undo and redo histories are also cleared from _Mastermind_.


##### Find
To find an item by name, the user will search through the `Storage` by calling "find `<task>`". It calls `FindCommand` to find the exact terms of the keywords entered by the user.

##### Findtag
To find an item by tag, the user will search through the `Storage` by calling "findtag `<tag>`". It calls `FindTagCommand` to find the exact terms of the keywords entered by the user.

##### List
Calling `list [tab_name]` will display the items in that category.


##### Upcoming
Calling `upcoming [task_type]` will updates the list to show the user task in the upcoming week. If `task_type` is indicated, it will show only tasks of that specified type.


##### Relocate
This command allows the user to specify the save location of the data file. The file path the user inputs is contained in an event and passed to the `Storage` component from the `Logic` component via the `EventsCenter`. `Relocate` relies on `FileUtil` to check whether the input file path is valid and writable first. It then raises an event to the `EventsCenter` to inform `Storage` to handle the command. Hence there is no coupling from `Logic` to `Storage`.


##### Import
The `import` command allows user to migrate their existing task list from other application to _Mastermind_. It supports `.csv` and `.ics` format currently. This command should append the imported task lists in _Mastermind_ instead of overwriting it.

Note that the `.csv` format must be compatible with [Google Calendar specification](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en) in order for _Mastermind_ succesfully parses the data.

The `.ics` format must comply with the [iCalendar](http://icalendar.org/) format. Please refer to the [RFC5545](http://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/iCalendar-RFC-5545/) for specification details.

The `import` command makes use of the following 3rd party libraries:
- [BiWeekly](https://github.com/mangstadt/biweekly) for parsing `.ics` format.
- [Apache Commons CSV](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/) for parsing `.csv` format.

##### Export
The `export` command allows user to export their task list from _Mastermind_ to `.csv` format. The exported format should comply with [Google Calendar specification](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en).

Due to the limitation of Google Calendar, it's mandatory to specify a valid start date and end date. In order to export floating and deadline tasks, we have made the following decisions:

- Floating Task: start & end date are set to exporting date; `All Day Event` field set to `TRUE`.
- Deadline Task: start & end date share the same date; `All Day Event` field set to `FALSE`.
- Event Task: start & end date are exported directly from _Mastermind_; `All Day Event` field set to`FALSE`.

In addition, the tags defined in _Mastermind_ will be exported in `Description` field.

##### History
This command allows users to toggle the Action History bar via the command line. The command will raise an event which will be handled by `UI`.


##### Help
Calling `help` will show a popup containing a command summary. To close the popup, press any key.

> An event will be raised in `Logic`, which will be handled by the `UI`.



##### Exit
This `exit` command runs when the user tries to exit the program, allowing the program to close.

> The undo and redo history will <b>not</b> be kept.

```
