### Recall your action history: `history`

_Mastermind_ remembers the list of commands you executed. If you ever forget what you've executed hours ago or are unsure of what you can `undo` or `redo`, you can ask _Mastermind_ to show you the history.

_Format:_
```java
history
```

_Example:_
```java
> history
```

> * _Quick Tip: You can also click on the status bar above the command field to open up your action history._
> * Clicking on the history entry will display the result of that particular command you executed on the right panel.
> * The command will toggle the status bar open or close.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Want to clear everything? _Mastermind_ can do some spring cleaning for you in all categories.

_Format:_
```java
clear
```

_Example:_
```java
// All tasks in all categories are deleted
> clear
```
> `clear` command cannot be undone. Make sure you really mean to discard everything on _Mastermind_!


### Exiting the program : `exit`

_Mastermind_ says, "Goodbye!"

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?  
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty mastermind.xml file it creates with the mastermind.xml file that contains the data of your previous Mastermind.
Alternatively you can use the export and import function. However if you use this method, the tags will not be added to the new application.

**Q**: Is my data secure?  
**A**: Your data is stored locally on your hard drive as a .xml file. Your data is as secure as your computer

**Q**: Where is the <kbd>save</kbd> button or command?  
**A**: Mastermind's data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Storage component

<img src="images/Storage_diagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the _Mastermind_'s data in xml format and read it back.

`Storage` is completely decoupled from the other components. It functions by taking events from the `EventsCenter`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `harmony.mastermind.commons` package.
This component will be maintained by developers working on any of the other components because of its wide scope of application. You can find 4 packages, namely: `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `utils`.
