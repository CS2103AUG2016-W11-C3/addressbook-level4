* [Command Summary](#command-summary)
* [Special Command Summary](#special-command-summary)


## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.  

2. Download the latest `mastermind.jar` from our repository's [releases](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C3/main/releases) tab.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mastermind.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The app should appear in a few seconds.
   > <img src="docs/images/latest_ui.PNG" width="600">

5. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it.


    > Some example commands you can try:
    >
    >   - `add CS2103T tutorial by tomorrow 11am`
    >       - adds a task named `CS2103T tutorial` with deadline due tomorrow at 11am.
    >   - `delete 1`
    >       - deletes the 1st task shown in the current list.


6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.  


## Features

### Command Formatting Style

>* Words in `angle brackets < >` are required parameters, fields in `square brackets [ ]` are optional.
>* Fields that are appended with `ellipsis ...` such as `<option_field>...` indicates that the field accept multiple of values.
>* Tasks will be added to the categories (event, deadlines, floating task) according to the keywords to the parameters inputed.
>* Parameters can be in any order.
>* Separate different tags with `comma ,`.
>* There are no limit to the number of tags a task can have.

### Viewing help : `help`

First, let's get familiar with the command features that _Mastermind_ offers! Type `help` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to display all the possible command usage.

_Format:_
```java
help
```

> _Quick Tip: Press any key to close the popup!_

### Adding a task: `add`, `do`

For now, an empty list is not very interesting. Try to create a new task using `add` or `do` command. Both commands are equivalent. They exist to help you in constructing a more fluent command structure.

_Mastermind_ automatically helps you to organize your task into three main categories:
- **Event**: Task with `startDate` and `endDate` specified.
- **Deadline**: Task with only `endDate` specified.
- **Floating Task**: Task without `startDate` and `endDate`.

> _Quick Tip: Tag your task so you can find them easier with `find` command!_
> - You can have multiple tags to your tasks! Simply just separate the different tags using a comma without a space.
> - There are no limit to the number of tags a task can have, feel free to tag as many as you like!

#### Adds an event  
_Format:_
```java
(add|do) <task_name> from <start_date> to <end_date> [#comma_separated_tags]
```

_Example:_
```java
> add attend workshop from today 7pm to next monday 1pm #programming,java
```
#### Adds a task with deadline
_Format:_

```java
(add|do) <task_name> by <end_date> [#comma_separated_tags]
```  

_Example:_

```java
> add submit homework by next sunday 11pm #math,physics
```  
#### Adds a floating task
_Format:_
```java
(add|do) <task_name> [#comma_separated_tags]
```  

_Example:_
```java
> do chores #cleaning
```  

#### Adds a recurring deadline
_Format:_
```java
(add|do) <task_name> by <end_date> [daily|weekly|monthly|yearly] [#comma_separated_tags]
```  

_Example:_
```java
> do chores today daily #cleaning
> do workshop from tomorrow 3pm to tomorrow 5pm weekly
```

> _Quick Tip: You can add recurring events too!_
> Use keywords like ```'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly' and 'yearly'``` for recurring tasks.

> _Mastermind_ uses [natural language processing](http://www.ocpsoft.org/prettytime/nlp/) for `<start_date>` & `<end_date>`, therefore it does not enforce any specific date format. Below are the possible list of date constructs that _Mastermind_ accepts:
>
> `tomorrow 6pm`
> `next saturday`
> `13 Oct 2016 6pm`
> `...`
>
> The list above is not exhaustive. Feel free to try any possible combination you have in mind!
>
> If the date you entered is incorrectly parsed, please enter a more explicit combination such as "tomorrow 6pm" instead of "tomorrow at 6".


### Editing a task : `edit`, `update`, `change`
Perhaps now you have a change of schedule, or you are unsatisfied with the task name you just created. _Mastermind_ allows you to quickly modify the task you created before using `edit` command.

_Format:_
```java
(edit|update|change) <index> [name to <name>,] [start date to <start_date>,] [end date to <end_date>,] [recur (daily|weekly|monthly|yearly),] [tags to #<comma_separated_tags>,]
```

>* At least one optional field is required.
>* You can edit as many fields as required.
>* Each field is separated by a comma.
>* You can omit the last `comma ,` if there's no more fields following:
>`edit 1 name to dinner with parents, start date to tomorrow 7pm`
>* Any malformed field will be dropped.

_Examples:_

```java
// Selects the 2nd task in Mastermind and edit the task name to Dinner.
> edit 2 name to parents with dinner, end date to tomorrow 7pm, recur daily, tags to #meal,family
```
```java
// Selects the 1st task and edit the `startDate` to tomorrow 8pm.
> change 1 start date to tomorrow 8pm
```
```

## Introduction
Welcome to _Mastermind_'s Developer Guide!  

_Mastermind_ is a to-do task manager that helps user keep track of their tasks. We aim to provide our users with an effective and efficient solution to managing their tasks so they are able to better handle their time, as well as completing tasks required.

This developer guide is for both existing and new developers of the team who are interested in working on _Mastermind_ in the future.  

This guide will show you the Product Architecture, APIs and the details regarding the different components.  

The next segment will show you how to set-up to make sure that you have the necessary tools before getting started. Feel free to approach our team for any clarifications that you may face during the process. Good luck and have fun coding!


## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later.  
    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.  
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE.
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Follow from step 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)).
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above).
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process).
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

### Troubleshooting Project Setup
1. **Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git:**  

    >Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.  
    >
    >Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse. Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project.  

2. **Eclipse reports some required libraries missing:**  

    >Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
    >
    >Solution: Run tests using Gradle once (to refresh the libraries).



## Design

### Software Architecture

To start off, let us introduce you to the overall structure of _Mastermind_. Do have a basic understanding of _Mastermind_'s different components before focusing on them individually.  

_Mastermind_ is split up into 5 main components, namely the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `Commons`, as shown below, in Figure 1.


<img src="images/Architecture_diagram.png" width="600">  
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke clean up method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level.
* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log files.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Memory`**](#memory-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:
* Defines its _API_, which is an interface with the same name as the component. `Logic.java`
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class e.g. `LogicManager.java`


The sections below give more details of each component.

#### UI component

`UI` is implemented by JavaFX 8 and consists of the main panel Main Window. This component primarily handles user input such as text input which will be entered via Command Line Input (CLI) as shown in Figure 2. On top of text input, users are also allowed to use keypress or mouse click. Inputs are passed on to the `Logic` component.  

If you are intending to work on the `UI`, you will need to update the application's internal state, which also includes:  
1.  UiManager.java  
2.  UiPartLoader.java  
3.  UiPart.java  


<img src="images/UI_diagram.png" width="800">  

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/harmony/mastermind/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to data in the `Model` so that the UI can automatically update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to some of the events raised from various parts of the App and updates  `UI` accordingly.

[insert ui class diagram]

We separated the UI into smaller components. Each components should handles the events raised by `EventCenter` if needed.

- `MainWindow.java`: handles the Tab name updates, initialize smaller components.
    - `CommandBox.java`: handles user input, listen to textfield change event.
    - `ActionHistoryPane.java`: display command result.
        - `ActionHistoryEntry.java`: renders each entry in the action history list.
    - `DefaultTableView.java`: an abstract class that define default table rendering algorithms. It should be extended by the following classes:
        - `HomeTableView.java`: display all tasks.
        - `TasksTableView.java`: display only floating tasks.
        - `EventsTableView.java`: display only events.
        - `DeadlinesTableView.java`: display only deadlines.
        - `ArchivesTableView.java`: display marked tasks.
- `HelpPopup.java`: display help window.

## Memory Component
This is the temporary memory where most changes regarding memory take place. This is before the information to be stored is transferred permanently in the storage.



## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging.Logger` as our logger, and `LogsCenter` is used to manage the logging levels of loggers and handlers (for output of log messages).

- The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file.
    > See [Configuration](#configuration).
- The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

- Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and `.log`.

**Logging Levels**

- SEVERE
  - Critical use case affected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application.

- WARNING
  - Can continue, but with caution.

- INFO
  - Information important for the application's purpose.
    - e.g. update to local model/request sent to cloud
  - Information that the layman user can understand.

- FINE
  - Used for superficial debugging purposes to pinpoint components that the fault/bug is likely to arise from.
  - Should include more detailed information as compared to `INFO` i.e. log useful information!
    - e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file. _Mastermind_ will load the xml data file from the file path specified in `config.json`.
> Stored as: `config.json`.


## Testing

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to `Run as` a `JUnit Test`.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes.  
      e.g. `harmony.mastermind`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).  
      e.g. `harmony.mastermind.commons.core`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together.  
      e.g. `harmony.mastermind.storage`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the ([TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)) library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running. See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation
See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration
We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform Continuous Integration on our projects to ensure that every time we merge a new feature into the main branch, automated testing is done to verify that the app is working. See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

## Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file you created.

## Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third party libraries. For example, _Mastermind_ depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:  
* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size).  
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).
